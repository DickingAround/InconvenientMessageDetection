This is a test file. The first one was relatively short. This new one is longer in order to attempt to exercise any edge cases with pixel-picking. Not sure what to expect since theoretically it works perfectly now. But it took a while to realize what it should be. So I'd rather be safe than sorry in the test messages. Of course, I could use a real file and just compare that. But what's the fun in that?
